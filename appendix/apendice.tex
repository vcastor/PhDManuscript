\chapter{Supplementary Scientific Details}

This chapter gathers scientific material that, for reasons of scope and
readability, could not be fully inserted in the main body of the thesis. While
not essential to follow the principal narrative, these details are provided to
offer a fuller and more transparent account of the work undertaken. They
include explicit proofs, coordinates of systems, output files, structural data
of developed code, plain text output files, and benchmarks that were taken
during the course of the research.

In some cases, the material here expands upon topics
briefly mentioned in earlier chapters; in others, it provides technical depth
or alternative perspectives that may be of interest to the reader.

\chapter{Author's Notes}

This chapter in contrast to the previous one has no physical chemistry or
mathematical content, but provides additional information about the workflow of
the thesis that in fact, was also a part of the main project of the PhD.
