In this chapter, we introduce the theoretical background that underpins this
thesis, rather than embarking on a historical journey, traversing through the
philosophies of the ancient Greeks or beginning with the standard model of
particle physics ---one of the most successful theories in modern science---
we will provide a concise and targeted overview that will enable the reader to
grasp the context of our work within the existing body of knowledge. Our aim
is not to reconstruct the entire chemistry from scratch.

We assume the reader possesses a solid grounding in science, including
familiarity with concepts from infinitesimal calculus, as well as terms
originating in chemistry and physics, such as nucleophilicity and entropy.
