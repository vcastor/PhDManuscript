\section{Electronic Density}\label{densidades}

The electronic density, $\rho(\mathbf{r})$, is a fundamental concept in modern
theoretical chemistry. It offers a compact yet informative description of a
system's electronic structure and plays a central role in density-based methods
such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), as well as in interpretative
frameworks like QTAIM.

For a system comprising two electrons with spin-spatial coordinates
$\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$, the electronic density is given by
$|\Psi(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2)|^2$~\cite{RobertG1994}.  To calculate the
probability of finding electron 1 in the volume element $\dd\mathbf{x}_1$ and
electron 2 in $\dd\mathbf{x}_2$, the full probability density must be
integrated over $\dd\omega_1 \dd\mathbf{x}_2$, where $\dd\mathbf{x}_n =
\dd\tau_n \dd\omega_n$.

\nt{

  Since the electrons are indistinguishable,
  for a system with $N$ electrons, the electronic density can be
  generalised as:
  %
  \begin{align}
    \rho(\mathbf{r})=N\int |\Psi (\mathbf{x}_1 ,  \mathbf{x}_2,  \ldots , \mathbf{x}_N)|^2
    \dd\omega_1 \dd\mathbf{x}_2 \ldots \dd\mathbf{x}_N ,
    \label{rho_definition}
  \end{align}

  \noindent such that:
  \begin{align}
    \int\rho (\mathbf{r})\dd\tau = N .
  \end{align}

}

In the case of a Slater Determinant (Hartree-Fock), the electronic density for
a closed shell with spatial orbitals ${\psi_a}$ can be written as:
%
\begin{align}
  \rho (\mathbf{r}) = 2 \sum_{a=1}^{\sfrac{N}{2}} |\psi_a (\mathbf{r})|^2 .
\end{align}

\newpage
For a system with $N$ particles, it is possible to write an operator for the
density $\hat{\rho}$ and then, get the expected value for the system
wavefunction,
%
\begin{align}
  \hat{\rho} = \sum_i^N \hat{\delta} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_0),
\end{align}

\noindent then $\rho (\mathbf{r})$ is a expected value of a quantum mechanics
operator, which can be written as:
%
\begin{align}
  \rho (\mathbf{r}_0) &= \int\Psi^{\star} (\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots , \mathbf{x}_N)
  \sum_i^N \hat{\delta} (\mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_0) \Psi (\mathbf{x}_1, \ldots , \mathbf{x}_N)
  \dd\mathbf{x}_1 \ldots \dd\mathbf{x}_N \nonumber \\
  & = \bra{\Psi} \hat{\rho} \ket{\Psi} 
\end{align}

The electronic density is not only central to theory but also accessible
experimentally. Unlike many aspects of the electronic structure,
$\rho(\mathbf{r})$ can be directly measured using techniques such as X-ray and
neutron diffraction~\cite{Kasai2018, Coppens1971}. This makes it a valuable
bridge between theory and experiment, allowing direct comparison between
computed and observed densities, a stringent test of the accuracy and
reliability of computational methods.

Going forward, it is also possible to establish a density function for an electron
couple, also called pair density, such that:
%
\begin{align}
  \rho_2(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2) = N(N-1)\int |\Psi(\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \ldots , \mathbf{x}_N)|^2
  \dd\omega_1 \dd\omega_2  \dd\mathbf{x}_3 \ldots \dd\mathbf{x}_N ,
  \label{d_pares}
\end{align}

\noindent where $\rho_2(\mathbf{r}_1,\mathbf{r}_2)N^{-1}(N-1)^{-1}$ determines
the normalised probability of simultaneously finding two electrons per volume
centered at positions $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$.  Two normalisation
conventions are found in the literature: LÃ¶wdin~\cite{Lwdin1955} introduced the
factor $N(N-1)$, corresponding to ordered electron pairs, while
McWeeny~\cite{mcweeny1969methods} proposed an additional division by two to
account for unordered pairs. This pair density is commonly expressed as a sum
of an uncorrelated term and a correlation contribution, $\rho_2(\mathbf{r}_1,
\mathbf{r}_2) = \rho(\mathbf{r}_1)\rho(\mathbf{r}_2) +
\rho_2^{xc}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)$.

The importance of the one- and two-electro densities stems from the fact that,
within the \gls{BOA} and in the absence of external fields, the total
electronic energy of the system can be expressed entirely in terms of these
densities.

      \mathbf{r}^{\,\prime}_1) \biggr |_{\mathbf{r}^{\,\prime}_1 \rightarrow \mathbf{r}_1}

      \dd\tau_2 \nonumber \\
    =&\ T + V_{ne} + V_{nn} + V_{ee} + V_{xc} ,
  \label{E_b-o}
  \end{align}

  the first term represents the kinetic energy of the electrons, while the
  second and third correspond to the electron-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus
  interactions, respectively. The fourth term describes the classical
  electron-electron repulsion, treated as the Coulomb interaction between
  one-electron densities. The final term introduces exchange-correlation effects
  through the pair density.

}

The exchange-correlation term, $V_{xc}$, is introduced by subtracting the
uncorrelated product $\rho(\mathbf{r}_1)\rho(\mathbf{r}_2)$ from the full pair
density $\rho_2(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)$. This isolates the
exchange-correlation contribution, capturing both the effects of electron
indistinguishability and the correlated response of the electron distribution
to the presence of another electron.

In practice, evaluating Equation~\ref{E_b-o} within an electronic structure
method requires expressing the electron densities in terms of the molecular
orbital basis functions $\phi_i$,
%
\begin{gather}
  \rho_1 (\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{ij} D_{ij}\phi_{i}(\mathbf{r})\phi_{j}(\mathbf{r}), \\
  \rho_2 (\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = \sum_{ijkl}d_{ijkl}\phi_{i}(\mathbf{r}_1) \phi_{j}(\mathbf{r}_1)
    \phi_{k}(\mathbf{r}_2)\phi_{l}(\mathbf{r}_2),
\end{gather}

\noindent where $D_{ij}$ and $d_{ijkl}$ are the elements of the first-
and second-order density matrices, respectively.
