\noindent In this section, we take as our starting point the well-known
Schrödinger Equation~\cite{Schrdinger1926}, postulated by Erwin Schrödinger in
1925. This equation governs the quantum dynamics of a single particle of mass
$m$ evolving under the influence of a potential $V$.

\vspace{0.3cm}%
\dfn{Schrödinger Equation}{
  \begin{equation}
    \gls{iunit}\gls{hbar}\pdv{}{t}\ket{\gls{Psi}(\mathbf{r},t)} =
      \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2
      + \widehat{V}(\mathbf{r},t) \right ] \gls{Psiket} =
    \gls{hamiltoniano}\ket{\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)}
    \label{sch_eq}
  \end{equation}
}
\vspace{0.3cm}%

In cases where the Hamiltonian does not depend explicitly on time, 
we may apply the method of separation of
variables. This allows us to factor the wavefunction as
$\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = e^{-\sfrac{iEt}\hbar} \psi(\mathbf{r})$ and
derive the time-independent Schrödinger equation:

\vspace{0.3cm}%
\keq{Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation}{
  \begin{equation}
    \gls{hamiltoniano} \ket{\psi(\mathbf{r})} = E \ket{\psi(\mathbf{r})},
    \label{time_indep_sch}
  \end{equation}

  \noindent where $E$ denotes the energy eigenvalue associated with the
  stationary state $\ket{\psi}$.

While the Schrödinger equation offers a fundamental description of
non-relativistic quantum systems, a complete treatment must incorporate
relativistic effects, using the Dirac equation~\cite{Dirac1928}.
Rather than delving into the complexities of relativistic quantum mechanics, we
focus on the challenges posed by molecules with many electrons. These systems
are particularly difficult to solve, as no analytic solutions are available
using current state-of-the-art mathematical techniques.

% these are captured by the Dirac equation
% (Equation~\ref{dirac_eq}):

% \nt{
%   \begin{equation}
%     i\hbar\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\psi - mc\psi = 0
%     \label{dirac_eq}
%   \end{equation}

%   \noindent where the $\gamma^\mu$ are the Dirac gamma matrices, which ensure
%   Lorentz covariance. The equation encodes the structure of spacetime via the
%   four-gradient $\partial_\mu$ and relates energy and momentum through the
%   invariant relation $E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4$.

\newpage
The complexity and intractability of solving many-electron molecular systems
necessitate the use of approximations. One of the earliest and most fundamental
of these is the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (\gls{BOA}). Although the BOA is
inherently contradictory to the principles of quantum mechanics, it remains a
powerful tool due to the significant mass difference between nuclei and
electrons.

This approximation is generally robust, as discussed by \v{C}urík and
Sutcliffe in \cite{urk2018} and \cite{Sutcliffe}. It allows us to
simplify the problem by treating nuclei as stationary, quasi-classical
particles relative to the much lighter and faster-moving electrons, which are
the primary particles of interest in our study.
