\chapter{Implementation of QTAIM in the AMS}

\vspace{2cm}%
In this chapter, we present the implementation of the Quantum Theory of Atoms
in Molecules (QTAIM) partition within the \ams.
We begin by outlining the legacy implementation that served as the foundation
for this work, highlighting its capabilities and limitations.

\vspace{0.7cm}%
The chapter concludes with a series of benchmark tests and validation results.
These serve both to illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the
implementation and to assess its computational performance across different
molecular systems.
